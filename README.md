# Call-Centre-Trends

## Overview
A comprehensive analysis to evaluate customer satisfaction, focusing on key metrics such as call answer and abandon rates, call distribution by time, and average speed of answer.
Developing an agent performance quadrant by correlating average handle time and calls answered to identify high-performing agents and operational bottlenecks.

## Business Requirement
>>>>Overall customer satisfaction

>>>>Overall calls answered/abandoned

>>>>Calls by time

>>>>Average speed of answer

>>>>Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

## Approaches
1. Data Collection:

Imported call center data containing information about calls, agent performance, resolution rates, satisfaction scores, and monthly trends.



2. Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values in satisfaction rates and resolution data.

Standardized date formats and corrected data entry errors.

Removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.



3. Data Analysis:

Calculated key metrics like total calls, resolution rates, satisfaction scores, and speed of answer for agents.

Grouped data by month to understand call trends over time.

4. Measures Created:

Answer Rate = (Calls Answered / Total Calls) * 100

Resolution Rate = (Resolved Calls / Total Calls) * 100

Average Speed of Answer in seconds

Agent-wise performance metrics



5. Data Visualization:

Used bar charts for monthly call trends.

Pie charts for call answer and resolution rates.

Gauge charts for satisfaction scores.

Tables to compare agent performance metrics.

Color-coded visuals to highlight key insights.
## Insights

1. Call Answer Rate:

81.08% of calls were answered, while 18.92% were unanswered.

This indicates a good response rate, though improvements are possible.



2. Call Resolution:

72.92% of calls were resolved successfully, with 27.08% remaining unresolved.

Suggests that the support team's resolution effectiveness is satisfactory but requires improvement.

3. Average Speed of Answer:

Calls were answered in an average of 67.52 seconds.

Lowering this metric could enhance customer satisfaction.



4. Average Customer Satisfaction:

The overall satisfaction score stands at 3.40 out of 5.

Indicates room for enhancing customer experiences.



5. Monthly Call Trends:

The number of calls remains fairly stable across months.

Identifying specific events or issues may explain these trends.

6. Agent Performance:

Becky, Dan, and Martha have relatively high performance based on calls answered and resolved.

The average speed of answer (around 65 to 70 seconds) shows consistency across agents.

## Recommendations
*Focus on improving call resolution rates and agent efficiency.

*Lower the average speed of answer to enhance customer experience.

*Recognize high-performing agents and address training needs for lower-performing ones.

*Identify peak call periods and optimize staffing accordingly.
